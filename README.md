# Baseball_Stats_Shiny
First time making a Shiny app and doing so in one afternoon. The program takes pitch level data from a CSV and extracts basic player stats. 
Not proud of the sloppy data handling, however the end result funcions properly and retrieves the statistics for each team and player correctly.
Other stats such as pitch percentages for each pitcher are visualized.
